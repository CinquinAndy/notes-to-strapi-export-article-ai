## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To get started with Strapi Exporter, you'll need to configure the following settings:
![img.png](images/img.png)

### 1. Go in "API Keys" tab
- (required) Add your Strapi API URL
    It's the link to your Strapi API, for example: `https://api.yourdomain.com`
![img_1.png](images/img_1.png)
- (required) Add your Strapi API Token
![img_2.png](images/img_2.png)
  (settings -> api tokens -> create new API Token)
then, give it the right permissions (at least, upload, and create permissions on the content type you want to use)
  (or just use a full-access token [in Token type configuration])
- (required) Add your OpenAI API Token
![img_3.png](images/img_3.png)
you need to create an account on OpenAI, and create an API key, then add it here
- (optional to improve the results) Add your ForVoyez API Token

### 2. Go in "Routes" tab
- Add a new route
- Give it a name, icon, url, subtitle
- for example, 
  - name : articles
  - icon : bird
  - url : /api/articles
  - subtitle : Create articles
- You can add multiple routes, for example, one for articles, one for pages, one for categories, etc.
![img_4.png](images/img_4.png)

### 3. Go in "Configuration" tab
- For each route, you can configure the fields you want to use, and the schema needed for the fields
in Strapi, go in Documentation -> Open Documentation
![img_5.png](images/img_5.png)
You will see the openapi schema, you can use it to create the schema for the fields you want to use
![img_6.png](images/img_6.png)
You need to check the POST method, and the schema needed for the fields you want to use
![img_7.png](images/img_7.png)
Copy the whole schema in the Strapi schema section in the obsidian plugin
![img_8.png](images/img_8.png)

Then, you need to describe the content you want to use, and you want to upload at the end,
in schema description, for exemple for me :
in Strapi Schema
```
{
  "data": {
    "title": "string",
    "content": "string",
    "seo_title": "string",
    "seo_description": "string",
    "slug": "string",
    ...
  }
```
In Strapi Description (just describe with your words the fields, to help the AI to understand what you want) : 
```
{
  "data": {
    "title": "the title of the article",
    "content": "the content normal of the article",
    "seo_title": "the seo optimized version of the title",
    "seo_description": "a summary of the content, seo optimized, for the seo optimized description",
    "slug": "the-slug-for-the-access-of-the-article",
    ...
  }
```
![img_9.png](images/img_9.png)

- And now, in the content field name, you need to write the main content attribute name, for example, in my case, it's "content"
it because we want to avoid the AI to rewrite the content field. (it's already written by us)

![img_10.png](images/img_10.png)

- Select the target Language. 
![img_11.png](images/img_11.png)

- click on "Generate Configuration", and wait the configuration to be generated
- check if it's coherent with what you want, and click on "Apply"

![img_12.png](images/img_12.png)

- Repeat the process for each route you want to use, (you can select an another route with the dropdown menu [select route])
- Reload the plugin (ctrl + r) to apply the changes
