## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To get started with Strapi Exporter, you'll need to configure the following settings:

- **Strapi URL**: The URL of your Strapi instance (e.g., `https://your-strapi-url`).
![img.png](img.png)
- **Strapi API Token**: Your Strapi API token for authentication. You can create an API token in your Strapi admin panel under "Settings" > "API Tokens".
![img_1.png](img_1.png)
![img_2.png](img_2.png)
- You need, at least, to have the following permissions:
  - article: create
  - upload: create
  - (you can also add full permissions, but it's not really recommended for security reasons)
![img_3.png](img_3.png)
  - (the token in the screenshot is not valid, don't try to use it üòå)
- **OpenAI API Key**: Your OpenAI API key for using GPT-3 to generate SEO-friendly content. You can get your API key from the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
![img_4.png](img_4.png)
  - this key is needed to use the GPT-3 API, which is used to generate the content of the article
  - (it need to access to "Model capabilities" with "write" permission)
![img_5.png](img_5.png)
  - (or with the "all" permission)
- **JSON Template**: The JSON template for the article fields in Strapi. Customize this according to your Strapi content type structure. You can find the JSON template in your Strapi API documentation (Swagger).
![img_6.png](img_6.png)
  - to get the JSON template, you can go to the documentation of your Strapi API, and copy the JSON template of the article creation
  - it should look like this: ``https://{api_url}/documentation/v1.0.0``
  - then, go to the article creation, and copy the JSON template
![img_7.png](img_7.png)
![img_8.png](img_8.png)
  - it should look like this for example:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "title": "string",
    "seo_title": "string",
    "seo_description": "string",
    "slug": "string",
    "excerpt": "string",
    "links": [
      {
        "id": "number",
        "label": "string",
        "url": "string"
      }
    ],
    "subtitle": "string",
    "type": "string",
    "rank": "number",
    "tags": [
      {
        "id": "number",
        "name": "string"
      }
    ],
    "locale": "string"
  }
}
```
- then, you can copy this JSON template in the settings of the plugin
- and copy that, to describe each field in the other JSON description setting
- **JSON Template Description**: A description for each field in the JSON template to help GPT-3 understand the structure. Follow the same schema as the JSON template to provide descriptions for each field.
```json
{
  "data": {
    "title": "<Title of the item, as a short string>",
    "seo_title": "<SEO optimized title, as a short string>",
    "seo_description": "<SEO optimized description, as a short string>",
    "slug": "<URL-friendly string derived from the title>",
    "excerpt": "<A short preview or snippet from the content>",
    "links": [
      {
        "id": "<Unique identifier for the link, as a number>",
        "label": "<Display text for the link, as a short string>",
        "url": "<URL the link points to, as a string>"
      }
    ],
    "subtitle": "<Subtitle or secondary title, as a short string>",
    "type": "<Category or type of the item, as a short string>",
    "rank": "<Numerical ranking or order priority, as a number>",
    "tags": [
      {
        "id": "<Unique identifier for the tag, as a number>",
        "name": "<Name of the tag, as a short string>"
      }
    ],
    "locale": "<Locale or language code, as a short string>"
  }
}
```
```

- **Strapi Article Create URL**: The URL to create articles in Strapi (e.g., `https://your-strapi-url/api/articles`).
  - to get the URL, you can go to the documentation of your Strapi API, and copy the URL of the article creation
  - it should look like this: ``https://{api_url}/documentation/v1.0.0``
  - then, go to the article creation, and copy the URL
- **Strapi Content Attribute Name**: The attribute name for the content field in Strapi (e.g., `content`). 
  - to get the attribute name, you can go to the documentation of your Strapi API, and copy the attribute name of the article creation, (it need to be the name of the attribute that contain the main content of the article, for me it's "content", but it can be different for you)
- **Additional Prompt** (optional): Additional prompt to provide context for GPT-3 when generating content. You can use this field to specify additional information or instructions for the AI model. Like your langage, the tone of the article, etc.
